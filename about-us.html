<p>Formation of the IndianCollege of Anaesthesiologists was the dream realization of Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists. The idea was conceived in 1998, established in 2008, as an academic trust under Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists.</p>

<h4>What is the ‘IndianCollege of Anaesthesiologists’?</h4>
<p>ICA is a non-governmental non-profitable, charitable, free standing, national academic institution with no commercial strings attached and supported by the Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists.</p>

<h4>Why the college? What is the need for?</h4>
<p>Even though there are areas of academic and clinical excellence in India, we have failed to achieve uniform standard in academic activities and safety culture. Apart from College of Anaesthesiologists existing in the developed world, most of the SAARC countries also have their own College of Anaesthesiologists which control and regulate anaesthesia curriculum and even admission to postgraduate programmes (Pakistan / Sri Lanka). The college is the custodian of academic promotion where as member organization stands for members welfare. Requirement for establishing college is to bring in equitable, affordable, uniform healthcare delivery at education in anaesthesia in India.</p>

<h4>Brief Background</h4>
<p>Need for establishing, ICA was suggested by Dr. (Mrs). Manorama Mittal, Ex-President ISA in 1998, passed by AGM 1999, 2000; prepared draft constitution, circulated in AGM 2001. Consent of formation was taken from AGM ISA in 2002.</p>

<p>Since no progress was visible till 2006 in to formation, AGM during ISA CON- 2009 decided to close the issue but finally sanctioned another year to establish ICA at New Delhi or NCR, failing which, to find options to establish elsewhere.</p>

<p>Timely intervention of Late Dr. BVR Sastry, Dr. VP Kumra and Dr. B. Radhakrishnan and whole hearted support of ISA Delhi, saved the project. ISA Delhi sanctioned a room of the ISA Delhi head quarter to be used for official purpose in establishment of the college till college has its own building.</p>

<p>Legal opinion was sought and opinions suggested to register as an autonomous body, since the college required independent registration number, PAN, emblem and IT exemption to grow as well as to attract resources. Under the present company / corporate laws, a society in another society cannot be established, and so establishing ICA with another PAN / emblem within ISA is not possible.</p>

<p>Accordingly the documents were prepared to form as an academic trust but the untimely demise of Dr. BVR Sastry, delayed the college registration.</p>

<p>A trust for the “Indian College of Anaesthesiologists” was formed with eight ISA members of National Governing Council and ISA Delhi Branch. Trust was registered at New Delhi on 21 Nov 2008 and inaugurated on 22 Nov 2008 at Delhi. College members proposed to celebrate 21 Nov of every year as our “Founders Day”/”Annual Day”.</p>

<p>Three committees Establishment, Education and Estate were constituted (with equal members in each-committee from Delhi and outside NCR) and powers delegated to them to go ahead with time bound programmes.</p>

<p>During the 1st ICA CON at New Delhi in 2009 executive committee members of ISA National and ICA met and solved most of the objections raised in the “trust deed” of ICA. Needed changes were brought. An agreement was reached, that was presented and ratified by the AGM at ISA CON at Chennai on 28th Dec 2009 and finally memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the ISA and ICA in June 2010, allowing ISA to monitor and promote ICA. All activities of ICA will be under ISA, but functioning of ICA will be independent although controlled by ISA. Needed amendments in ISA constitution was brought out.</p>
